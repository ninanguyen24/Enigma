# Enigma
Design and Implement a Java class named Enigma that simulates a three-ring model of an Enigma machine.
Assume that all Enigma models have the same outer rotor. The Outer Rotor consists of 26 capital letters
and the '#' symbol in a clockwise order. Using an Enigma object, it should be possible to both encode
and decode text messages with the appropriate rotation of the rotors.
